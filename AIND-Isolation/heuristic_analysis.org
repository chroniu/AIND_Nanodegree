#+TITLE: AIND-Isolation - CUstom Heuristics Analysis
 
Have at least three (3) evaluation heuristics besides null_score(), open_move_score(), and improved_score() been implemented and analyzed?

At least three evaluation functions are implemented and analyzed.


---

Has the performance of agents against the testing agents been adequately described?

A brief report lists (using a table and any appropriate visualizations) and verbally describes the performance of agents using the implemented evaluation functions. Performance data includes results from tournament.py comparing (at a minimum) the best performing student heuristic against the ID_Improved agent.



---------------

Does the report make a recommendation about the best evaluation function, and is this recommendation adequately justified?


The report makes a recommendation about which evaluation function should be used and justifies the recommendation with at least three reasons supported by the data.
